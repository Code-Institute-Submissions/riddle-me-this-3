# The Simon Game

I'm a student at Code Institute and I've reached my third milestone project which was to create this webapplication.

## What does it do??

This website shows riddles and waits for answer from the user.
It checks if the answers are right or not, saves the user and his points.
It shows the points of all the users in a leaderboard.

### Getting the code up and running

1. Firstly you will need to clone this repository by running the git clone <project's Github URL> command
2. After you've that you'll need to make sure that you have npm installed
3. After those dependencies have been installed you'll need to make sure that you have http-server installed. You can install this by running the following: npm install -g http-server # this also may require sudo on Mac/Linux
4. Once http-server is installed run http-server -c-1
5. The project will now run on localhost
